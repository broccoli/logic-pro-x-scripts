# logic-pro-x-scripts

This is a repository for scripts for Logic Pro X's Scripter midi plugin.  The scripts are written in javascript.  But the Scripter editor saves the scripts as .pst file for Logic Pro plugins.  The code from a js file here should be copied and pasted into the Scripter editor and then saved with Save As....
